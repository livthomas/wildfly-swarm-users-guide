= Gradle Plugin

To assist in building WildFly Swarm projects, a Gradle plugin is available.  This plugin creates the ```-swarm.jar``` uberjar which contains your application along with the necessary parts of WildFly to support it.

NOTE: Gradle doesn't get the same attention by the core developers as Maven. If you want to be on the safe side, use Maven. If you are interested in contributing to the Gradle build system, please let us know!

== Packaging your application

To use the plugin, you must add it to your `build.gradle`:

[source,groovy]
----
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenLocal()
    mavenCentral()
  }

  dependencies {
    classpath "org.wildfly.swarm:wildfly-swarm-plugin:1.0.0.Alpha9-SNAPSHOT"
  }
}

apply plugin: 'wildfly-swarm'
----

To produce the `_myapp_-swarm.jar`, simply perform a `gradle wildfly-swarm-package` command after adding the plugin.

== Using the WildFly Swarm BOM

WildFly Swarm provides a BOM that specifies the versions for all of the provided fractions. To import it into your gradle build, you'll need to use the https://github.com/spring-gradle-plugins/dependency-management-plugin[dependency-management-plugin]:

[source,groovy]
----
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenLocal()
    mavenCentral()
  }

  dependencies {
    classpath "io.spring.gradle:dependency-management-plugin:0.5.6.RELEASE"
    classpath "org.wildfly.swarm:wildfly-swarm-plugin:1.0.0.Alpha9-SNAPSHOT"
  }
}

apply plugin: "io.spring.dependency-management"
apply plugin: 'wildfly-swarm'


dependencyManagement {
  imports {
    mavenBom "org.wildfly.swarm:bom:1.0.0.Alpha9-SNAPSHOT"
  }
}

dependencies {
  compile "org.wildfly.swarm:jaxrs"
}
----


== Configuration

You can optionally provide configuration to the plugin.

=== Configuration Options

The plugin accepts the following options:

[cols=3, options="header"]
|===
|Name
|Description
|Default

|bundleDependencies
|If true, dependencies will be included in the -swarm.jar. Otherwise, they will be resolved from `$M2_REPO` or the network.
|true

|mainClassName
|A class to execute as the main. If not set, the plugin will check for `mainClassName` from the `application` plugin before using the default.
|org.wildfly.swarm.bootstrap.Main

|modules
|Paths to a directory containing additional module definitions
|./modules

|properties
|(see properties section below)
|

|propertiesFile
|(see properties section below)
|

|archiveTask
|A Jar-Task which should be wrapped instead of the JAR-Task (Java-Plugin) or WAR-Task (WAR-Plugin)
|
|===


=== Properties

Many properties may be used to configure execution and affect the packaging or running of your application.

If you set a `properties` map or the `propertiesFile` field in the `swarm` block in your build script, the properties will be added to your `_myapp_-swarm.jar` to affect subsequent executions of the uberjar.  Any properties loaded from `propertiesFile` will override same-named properties from `properties`.

Any properties added to the uberjar can of course be overridden at runtime using the traditional `-Dname=value` mechanism of `java`.

Only properties specified outside of `properties` or `propertiesFile` that start with `jboss.`, `wildfly.`, or `swarm.`, or override a property specified in `properties` or `propertiesFile` are added to the uberjar at package time.


Please see <<fake/../../../configuration_properties.adoc#,Configuration Properties>> for a non-exhaustive list of useful properties.

=== Example

[source,groovy]
----
swarm {
  properties {
    swarm.http.port = 8181
    my.app.property = 'biscuits'
  }

  bundleDependencies = false
  moduleDirs = [new File(buildDir, 'resources/main/modules')]
  propertiesFile = new File(buildDir, "resources/main/some.properties")
}
